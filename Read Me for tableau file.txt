This is for Tableau-Challenge. 

ABOUT TABLEAU:
Tableau is a powerful tool that will provide results in an interactive way!
I would not that if we have Tableau Server this will be much easier to submit Dashboards. 
In our current state you see data sheet that either needs to be extracted as a Tableau file
or load it on GitHub. 
Paying a bit more with Tableau Server would provide us the opprotunity to work on line and load 
Dashboards without the support of sheets. 
We could also have our data loaded into the server which will provide rapid live data driven decisions. 
Currently, we will have the extract the data and have large data to start the process of having slower computers. 

The data that is currently on the site is too big for conventional visualizations to use. 
The currently data set that was used is from January 2018 till Present. 
Data this big caused times of "blackout" and the data stopped interacting with our product.

DATA:
Two items that Tableau quickly picked up was customers with unrealistic ages and having an unknown gender. 
It is quite a bit of data exaggerates the realistic data and provides false readings with data. 


INTERACTIONS:
I created an interaction with the map. 
When you are on the Top/Bottom 10 Service Stations Dashboard, you can pick a station and it will 
move over to the map with lines of each ride by the milage that was rode.
